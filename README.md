# Room_LED_Strip
In the LEDS folder you will find a single arduino project file.
The project is unfinshed, and there is a lot more functionality that could be added to it,
but it is working, and for now without any apparent bugs
The code's logic is documented in the code but the format which the commands are written is spescified in a differnet txt file.

The LED is controled by an android app that I wrote and I will upload it soon.
